Hey, <%= @first_name %>!

It's been a minute since you last heard from me. I hope you are doing well!

Today marks a bittersweet milestone. As of today, we have <%= Pledge.count %> total pledges and I am honored that you joined us in this journey.

Sadly, it is time to close up shop for the Advance Manifesto website due to ongoing costs. While the site will no longer be live, you can still access the source code at https://github.com/advancethemiddle/advancemanifesto.

The source code is not the only thing that will live on, though. I trust that, as we continue to advance the next generation of technologists, we will leave a lasting mark for those ahead and behind us.

So thank you, <%= @first_name %>, for your pledge to make our industry a better place. If you'd like to stay in touch, drop me a line at https://www.linkedin.com/in/sunjayarmstead. I can't wait to hear from you. Truly, it's not goodbye, it's see you later!

Warm regards,

Sunjay
